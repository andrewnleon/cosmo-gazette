      "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System and is responsible for the Earth's climate and weather. It is a medium-sized star, about half way through its life. The Sun is made up of hot plasma (a superheated, ionized gas) and generates energy through nuclear fusion. It is the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun's diameter is about 109 times that of Earth and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth.",
